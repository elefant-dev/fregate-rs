# TODO(kos): Consider describing each field and adding example with all full
#            config. It will make more comfortable to use the crate.
#            As example:
#            https://github.com/coturn/coturn/blob/4.6.0/examples/etc/turnserver.conf

host = "0.0.0.0"
port = 8000

[log]
level = "info"
# enabled = true              # Whether you want to store log in log files.
# TODO(kos): Should probably have extra parameters. Like, log to file, or
#            exclude/include concrete modules from logging?

[trace]
level = "info"
# enabled = true              # Whether tracing/telemetry is enabled.
# TODO(kos): Should probably have extra parameters.
